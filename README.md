## 👋 Hi there! I'm Surya Kiran

🎓 I'm a third-year student at Maynooth University, pursuing a B.Sc. Computer Science & Software Engineering (Lvl 8). I've been learning software development for about 5 years and I spend most of my time recently learning web-apps, music and cooking. My learning is driven by curiosity, hands-on practice, and the desire to create meaningful tech.

## 💼 About Me

🔹 I am actively looking for an Internship in Ireland or remote (2025/2026)

🔹 I’ve honed my skills in languages and frameworks such as **JavaScript**, **Java**, **Python**, **C++**, **Tailwind**, **React**, **Node.js**, **MongoDB** and many more.

🔹 My skils are grounded in Java and JavaScript, mainly focused on web-apps but I'm someone who's open to learning and exploring more posibilities.

🔹 I regularly build personal projects and post them on GitHub. These include api-tools, data-driven systems, and some fun projects.
